# Stacker

## Development

### Building

The generic `assemble` and `build` tasks will attempt to build for all supported architectures, which cannot be done
locally. Instead, run the gradle task for your current architecture:

* `./gradlew linkReleaseExecutableMacosArm`
* `./gradlew linkReleaseExecutableMacosX64`

Debug variants are available by replacing `Release` with `Debug`. Other architectures are not currently supported.

### Running

After building, an executable will be available in the `build` folder. Its exact path will depend on the task that was
used to build it. For reference, a release macOS ARM build will be available at
`build/bin/macosArm64/debugExecutable/stacker.kexe`.
